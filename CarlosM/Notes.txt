# Problem Definition
Clearly defining the business problem or question to be solved. This ensures the project's objectives are aligned with organizational goals.
# Problem Definition Consolidated Notes
- A Data Science project to be developed considering diverse approaches in terms of tools
- This document aims to develop the project with python.
- Data Science project will be developed following the Data Science Life Cycle (DSLC)

# Data Collection
Gathering relevant data from various sources, such as databases, APIs, or external datasets, ensuring it supports the problem statement.
# Data Collection Consolidated Notes
- The project will consider the data provided by the academy
- Web scraping involves automatically extracting data from websites, which can be subject to legal restrictions depending on the website's policies and applicable laws.

# Data Preparation
Cleaning, preprocessing, and organizing the data. This includes handling missing values, outliers, data transformations, and feature engineering
# Data Preparation Consolidated Notes 
- The variable 'Unnamed' represent index and should be deleted from data
- Target variable for modeling is "price"
- There are 16376 rows and 10 columns. 
- Project1 data had 8188 rows and 10 columns.
- Data types are aligned with information, except variables 'rooms' and 'bathroom' being float and expected integer
- There are missing data (NaN) on multiple variables
- Units size goes from 10m2 to 679m2, with a mean of 84.36m2
- Units prices goes from 320EUR to 15000EUR/month, with mean of 1437EUR/month
- price range is assumed referred to monthly rent, so considered as EUR per month
- Units prices by square meter goes from 4.549EUR/m2/month to 197.272EUR/m2/month, with mean of 17.73EUR/m2/month
- There are units listed with cero rooms and 10.754 rooms
- There are units with 0.9 bathroom
- There are four types of real states being the most common "flat"
- Most units do not have terrace
- Most units do have lift
- The neighborhood with largest unit count is "Eixample"
- The variable 'rooms' will require feature engineering
- The variable 'bathroom' will require feature engineering
- The total number of observations with an integer number for variable "rooms" is 8000, this represents 48.85% of total observations
- The total number of observations with an integer number for variable "bathroom" is 8210, this represents 50.13% of total observations
- Considering high proportion of invalid values (not integer) on variables 'rooms' and 'bathroom' (51.15% and 49.87%), and Project2 dataset is stated as an augmented version of Project1 dataset, is interpreted Project1 dataset was augmented adding artificial data to make it larger, and in this process of **Data Augmentation** those observations with decimal values where not corrected to integers into Project2 dataset.
- There are no duplicated observations
**Missing Value handling**
- 389 out of 408 missing "square_meters" values are imputed considering relation "price" / "square_meters_price"
- 420 out of 439 missing "square_meters_price" values are imputed considering relation "price" / "square_meters"
- There are 19 properties missing values on both "square_meters" and "square_meters_price"
- 19 missing "square_meters_price" values are imputed with the most relevant mean based on the "real_state" and "neighborhood".
- 19 missing "square_meters" values are imputed considering relation "price" / "square_meters_price"
- Imputed missing "real_state" values by filling them with the most common (mode) "real_state" for each "neighborhood".
- 408 missing "rooms" values are imputed with the most relevant mean based on the "real_state" and "neighborhood".
- 387 missing "bathroom" values are imputed with the most relevant mean based on the "real_state" and "neighborhood".



### Consolidated notes on Exploratory Data Analysis

- univariate_numerical(data): Function to generate two plots for each numerical variable. Histplot for variable distribution. Boxplot for statistical summary
- univariate_categorical(data): Function to generate countplot for each categorical variable. Labeled with count and percentage
- plot_crosstab_bar_count(df, var_interest): Function to create a barplot of crosstab of the variable of interest vs each of the rest of categorical variables. Labeled with counts
- plot_crosstab_heat_perc(df, var_interest): Function to create a heatmap of crosstab of the variable of interest vs each of the rest of catagorical variables. Labeled with counts, percentage by row, percentage by column
- boxplot_by_group(df, group, var, outliers): boxplot for a numerical variable of interest vs a categorical variable. with or without outliers. includes data mean and mean by category
- side_by_side_boxplot(df1, df2, group, var, outliers, title1, title2): to present two side by side boxplot_by_group
- The variables "Unnamed: 0" have a uniform distribution
- The numerical variables are right skewed
- Noticeable the not integer 'rooms' samples
- Noticeable the not integer 'bathroom' samples
- The categorical variables are not balanced, with 77.2% of properties as "flats" and 79.1% of units concentrated in 50% of the sample neighbourhoods
- 75% of flats units have up to 3 bedrooms and up to 2 bathrooms with an average size of 85.48m2.
- 75% of the units in Eixample have up to 3 bedrooms and up to 2 bathrooms with an average size of 85.96m2.
- 'square_meters' has a positive correlation with 'price', 'rooms' and 'bathrooms'
- 'square_meters_price' has a negative correlation with 'square_meters', 'rooms' and 'bathrooms'
- There are only one couple of variables with high correlation: bathroom-square_meters (0.75)
- Top 3 neighborhood by price mean value are: Sarria-Sant Gervasi,Eixample,Les Corts
- Top 3 neighborhood by square_meters mean value are: Sarria-Sant Gervasi,Les Corts,Eixample
- Top 3 neighborhood by square_meters_price mean value are: Eixample,Ciutat Vella,Sant Martí
- Top 3 real_state by price mean value are: apartment,attic,flat
- Top 3 real_state by square_meters mean value are: attic,flat,apartment
- Top 3 real_state by square_meters_price mean value are: apartment,attic,study
- From the perspective of price per square meter, the most attractive type of unit according to this data could be the **flat**, with an average surface area of ​85.48 m2 (just over the average 84.37 m2) and a price per square meter of 15.71 below the average (17.73)
- There are 3693 flats in Eixample, being the most popular unit type and neighborhood combination, with 80.79% of the units in Eixample being flats, and 29.19% of all flats are located at Eixample. 
- Across all neighborhoods, the unit type "flat" is the most popular with at least 77.49% of units by neighborhood
- Most types of units have a lift, in the case of flats the proportion is 72.86%
- Units with a terrace on the other hand, seem to be rare and very few have one
