# Problem Statement

## Objective
Expand the analysis and predictive modeling of housing prices in Barcelona using advanced tools such as KNIME for ETL and analysis, Power BI for interactive visualization, and AutoML tools as a Low-Code or No-Code Machine Learning platform. The goal is to **improve the accuracy of the predictive model and provide interactive visualizations** that facilitate decision making.

## Project Approach
Since this is a continuation of Project 1, with a database that maintains its structure (same variables) and expands the number of records, the following stages are proposed:

1. Python. Data analysis and modeling using Python, adapting Project 1 to the new expanded database. This stage will serve as a basis for comparisons of both the results and the process carried out with the proposed tools.

2. KNIME_PowerBI. Data analysis and modeling using KNIME, and complemented for visualizations with PowerBI.

3. AutoML. Data analysis and modeling using Machine Learning and AI tools in the capacities provided by the free versions of the same. The following tools are considered:
	- Google AutoML
	- BigML
	- H2o.ai
	- Microsoft Azure Machine Learning
	- Obviously.ai
	- IBM's Watson
	- Amazon's Sage Maker
	- streamlit.io


# Consolidated notes on Data Overview
- The variable 'Unnamed' represent index and should be deleted from data
- Target variable for modeling is "price"
- There are 16376 rows and 10 columns. 
- Project1 data have 8188 rows and 10 columns.
- Data types are aligned with information, except variables 'rooms' and 'bathroom' being float and expected integer
- There are missing data (NaN) on multiple variables
- Units size goes from 10m2 to 679m2, with a mean of 84.36m2
- Units prices goes from 320EUR to 15000EUR/month, with mean of 1437EUR/month
- price range is assumed referred to monthly rent, so considered as EUR per month
- Units prices by square meter goes from 4.549EUR/m2/month to 197.272EUR/m2/month, with mean of 17.73EUR/m2/month
- There are units listed with cero rooms and 10.754 rooms
- There are units with 0.9 bathroom
- The total number of observations with an integer number for variable "rooms" is 8000, this represents 48.85% of total observations
- The total number of observations with an integer number for variable "bathroom" is 8210, this represents 50.13% of total observations
- Considering high proportion of invalid values (not integer) on variables 'rooms' and 'bathroom' (51.15% and 49.87%), and Project2 dataset is stated as an augmented version of Project1 dataset, is interpreted Project1 dataset was augmented adding artificial data to make it larger, and in this process of **Data Augmentation** those observations with decimal values where not corrected to integers into Project2 dataset.
- There are four types of real states being the most common "flat"
- Most units do not have terrace
- Most units do have lift
- The neighborhood with largest unit count is "Eixample"
- The variable 'rooms' will require feature engineering
- The variable 'bathroom' will require feature engineering
- There are no duplicated observations


### Consolidated notes on Exploratory Data Analysis

- univariate_numerical(data): Function to generate two plots for each numerical variable. Histplot for variable distribution. Boxplot for statistical summary
- univariate_categorical(data): Function to generate countplot for each categorical variable. Labeled with count and percentage
- plot_crosstab_bar_count(df, var_interest): Function to create a barplot of crosstab of the variable of interest vs each of the rest of categorical variables. Labeled with counts
- plot_crosstab_heat_perc(df, var_interest): Function to create a heatmap of crosstab of the variable of interest vs each of the rest of catagorical variables. Labeled with counts, percentage by row, percentage by column
- boxplot_by_group(df, group, var, outliers): boxplot for a numerical variable of interest vs a categorical variable. with or without outliers. includes data mean and mean by category
- side_by_side_boxplot(df1, df2, group, var, outliers, title1, title2): to present two side by side boxplot_by_group
- The variables "Unnamed: 0" have a uniform distribution
- The numerical variables are right skewed
- Noticeable the not integer 'rooms' samples
- Noticeable the not integer 'bathroom' samples
- The categorical variables are not balanced, with 77.2% of properties as "flats" and 79.1% of units concentrated in 50% of the sample neighbourhoods
- 75% of flats units have up to 3 bedrooms and up to 2 bathrooms with an average size of 85.48m2.
- 75% of the units in Eixample have up to 3 bedrooms and up to 2 bathrooms with an average size of 85.96m2.
- 'square_meters' has a positive correlation with 'price', 'rooms' and 'bathrooms'
- 'square_meters_price' has a negative correlation with 'square_meters', 'rooms' and 'bathrooms'
- There are only one couple of variables with high correlation: bathroom-square_meters (0.75)
- Top 3 neighborhood by price mean value are: Sarria-Sant Gervasi,Eixample,Les Corts
- Top 3 neighborhood by square_meters mean value are: Sarria-Sant Gervasi,Les Corts,Eixample
- Top 3 neighborhood by square_meters_price mean value are: Eixample,Ciutat Vella,Sant Martí
- Top 3 real_state by price mean value are: apartment,attic,flat
- Top 3 real_state by square_meters mean value are: attic,flat,apartment
- Top 3 real_state by square_meters_price mean value are: apartment,attic,study
- From the perspective of price per square meter, the most attractive type of unit according to this data could be the **flat**, with an average surface area of ​85.48 m2 (just over the average 84.37 m2) and a price per square meter of 15.71 below the average (17.73)
- There are 3693 flats in Eixample, being the most popular unit type and neighborhood combination, with 80.79% of the units in Eixample being flats, and 29.19% of all flats are located at Eixample. 
- Across all neighborhoods, the unit type "flat" is the most popular with at least 77.49% of units by neighborhood
- Most types of units have a lift, in the case of flats the proportion is 72.86%
- Units with a terrace on the other hand, seem to be rare and very few have one
